Overview                                         *lookup-overview*

Lookup is a vim plugin for vim script developers which allows you to quickly
find command/function/variable definitions/references or lookup vim docs for
the element under the cursor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites                                    *lookup-prerequisites*

Lookup is only enabled for files of file type 'vim' and requires that you have
file type plugins enabled (|:filetype-plugin-on|), as well as syntax
highlighting turned on (|:syntax-enable|).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage                                            *lookup-usage* *:Lookup*

To use Lookup, simply place the cursor on the element you want to find and
run the :Lookup command.  If you are on the name of a command, function, or
variable definition then Lookup will find all the references and populate the
quickfix list with the results.  If you are on a reference of a command,
function, or variable, then Lookup will find the definition(s). If you are on
a vim builtin command, variable, expression, etc. then in most cases Lookup
will open the help topic for that element.

Note: Lookup relies on vim syntax highlighting to help determine context and
the type of element to lookup, so some lookups won't return any results if
syntax is disabled.

The process of locating results for your :Lookup request involves:
1. Determining the context of the element under the cursor and building an
   appropriate search pattern.
2. Determining the path(s) to search. If |g:LookupRuntimePath| is set to 'all',
   then each path in your |'runtimepath'| will be searched. However, if
   |g:LookupRuntimePath| is set to 'relative', the default, then the path to
   search is determined by walking up the directory structure starting at the
   current file's directory until a standard vim directory is found (plugin,
   ftplugin, etc.). For vimrc files, the vimrc file and either the .vim or
   vimfiles sibling directory will be searched.
3. Once the paths to search have been determined, Lookup will then create a
   new quickfix list and issue a |:vimgrepadd| on each path for the search
   pattern built in step #1.

Instead of typing the :Lookup command, you're encouraged to map it to the key
sequence of your choice inside an ftplugin file (ftplugin/vim/<foo>.vim,
ftplugin/<bar>_vim.vim). Below is an example which maps <cr> to :Lookup. The
surrounding if statement prevents <cr> from being mapped when in vim's
|command-line-window| (the regex may need to be updated for your locale): >

  if bufname('%') !~ '^\(command-line\|\[Command Line\]\)$'
    nnoremap <silent> <buffer> <cr> :Lookup<cr>
  endif
>

The :Lookup command can also be invoked with an argument which can be either a
command name (with the leading ':'), variable name (with the leading scope:
'g:', 'b:', etc), or function name and will search for the definition of that
element.

Ex: >

  :Lookup :MyCommand
  :Lookup g:MyVar
  :Lookup MyFunction
  :Lookup foo#MyFunction
>

Configuration                                    *lookup-configuration*

- *g:LookupRuntimePath* (Default: 'relative')
  Specifies whether all paths in your runtime path will be search or just the
  path which the current file resides in. Possible values include 'all' or
  'relative'.
- *g:LookupSingleResultAction* (Default: 'edit')
  Specifies what action to take when a single result is found. Possible values
  include 'split', 'edit', or 'copen'.
